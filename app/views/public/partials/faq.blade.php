                                Our Move In/Out cleaning is designed to prepare an apartment or house for a new tenant; there's typically more room to be vacuumed, more baseboards to be detail cleaned, more cabinet and drawer space to be cleaned, light fixtures, etc. You can select it on our booking form under 'extras'. Please keep in mind that cleaning inside the fridge and oven are separate from our regular and move out cleanings.

                                No, you can leave a key for us to get in and we'll handle it from there. Some of our clients leave their key under a mat, in the mailbox, at a front-desk, or somewhere else out of sight. If you book online just remember to tell us where the key will be in the instructions, otherwise just give us a call.
