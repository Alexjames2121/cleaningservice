                        <em>Used MaidSavvy for the first time last week - our 2 bedroom apartment really needed a deep scrubbing, and my oven practically needed to be exorcised.<br>
                            I loved the online scheduling, and I ADORE the fact that they do cleanings on the weekends - it makes it so much easier for us, since we have to get our doggie out of the house during maid service (and it's better to take him for a long walk than to board him).<br>
                            Everything looked and smelled great when they were done, and the whole experience was seamless and easy.</em>

                        <em>I've been a maids in black user for more than a year and they've always done a great job, but after yesterday's cleaning with Jacqueline's team I just had to write a review.<br>
                            They went above and beyond, - every nook and cranny was cleaned, the towels were arranged throughout the house. They even remade the beds. On top of the very thorough cleaning, the team was very friendly and pleasant. They even played with my son!<br>
                            If you're looking for a cost-effective service that will give you the most for your money, this is it.</em>

                        <em>We've been using this company to clean our place once a month for about the past six months.  The service has been consistently good -- on time and thorough.<br>
                            The best part is the ease of scheduling and payment.  We had another maid service that we used, but they were constantly trying to schedule us at THEIR convenience, rather than ours, and canceling or changing appointments, which drove us nuts.  And, they had no e-mail or text messaging.<br>
                            With MaidSavvy, everything is done very easily via e-mail, which is perfect.</em>
